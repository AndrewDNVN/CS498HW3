# Project for CS 498 Unit Testing

Most of the code used is from the provided files; with modifications.

How to compile for testing:

g++ -Wall --std=c++17 "{YOUR_ABS_PATH_TO}/498HW3/test_reverse.cpp" -o "{YOUR_ABS_PATH_TO}/498HW3/test_reverse" && "{YOUR_ABS_PATH_TO}/498HW3/test_reverse"

The -c is used to link the files together and is needed.
